# JoinUO Website + Poller

After droping UO Is Not Dead, I've joined JoinUO team to make a new portal. It's not active anymore.

For this I've used the php Yii Framework 1.1. The poller was coded in pure php.

All the poller code is on the `poller.php` file. And the database schema is on `joinuo.mwb`.

The site template was not designed by me, it was available for free on the Internet.
