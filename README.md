# JoinUO Website + Poller

After droping UO Is Not Dead, I've joined JoinUO team to make a new portal, today available at [http://uoportal.com](http://uoportal.com/).

For this I've used the php Yii Framework 1.1. The poller was coded in pure php.

The site template was not designed by me, it was available for free on the Internet.
